## Prompt 1: Define Cluster

We're going to be working on a space conquest game inspired by "Neptune's Pride" with different, slightly more complex mechanics. Write a brief README.md and VISION.md for this project. Here is the draft of the ruleset: Cluster
The central goal of Cluster is to be an obsessive slow real-time strategy game in which the players compete to dominate the galaxy, but in which no single player has the resources or power to win on their own, making diplomacy and cooperation key to establishing a winning alliance or a winning play.
Like many diplomacy games, Cluster games are likely to have their share of betrayals but I believe the better game experience will be one that rewards alliance formation and meta-game play so that the dominant experience of the game is one where players are challenged to form alliances that win the game, and yet are incentivised to form alliances with different players each time ensuring uniqueness and “fairness” for gameplay.
Cluster’s game concepts are meant to be few in number, with richness of choices and game flavour provided by subtypes within each concept that create matrices of possibility, exploding the game complexity or collapsing it as desired by having fewer or more elements of each type.
Central Concepts
The game will be built around the following central concepts:
Stars, the proxy for territory, need to be controlled and their planetary systems’ resources harvested efficiently in order to win the game. Ultimately, control of either a sufficient number of stars or a sufficient number of resources will be the metric for victory.
Stars will have types according to the real classification system for stars, which include class O, B, A, F, G, K, M. Possibly not every class will be needed to create sufficient flavour, for the starting game I think we should select 4 classes of the 7 and see how that plays.
TODO: Make female and male versions, and/or androgenous versions.
TODO: Remove backgrounds (eg: the square and circle backgrounds)
M - Red Dwarf eg: Betelgeuse (coolest, smallest)
Slimy water creatures

G - eg: Sol
Humanoid creatures

A - White Dwarf
Insectoid creatures

O - Blue (hottest, largest)
Reptilian creatures

Factions, each with a bias towards a particular star type that enables better use of those stars’ planetary systems.
Faction names and powers will be arbitrary and a potential source of story/flavour text for the game.
Possibly it will be desirable to have two faction types per star type so that there is variety even within a certain star type choice
To start, 4 factions seem desirable.

Just between 4 star types and factions we already have a matrix of 16 possibilities for game play, each cell of which can affect all other parameters of the game.
Developments, which one can think of as “buildings” that harvest planetary resources and turn them into currency that can be spent in some way.
Galactic credits can be produced by markets, which also enable interstellar trading and speculation
Fighter pilots can be produced by military satellite training camps, and are the main mechanism for taking over orbital space around a system
Infantry can be produced by military bases, and are the mechanism for taking over control of a system’s production facilities
Scientific research is conducted in space stations, which produce science knowledge for the empire

In other words, at each star the user can build M/T/B/S - Markets, Training Camps, Bases, and/or Space Stations, which each will produce credits, fighters, infantry, and science respectively. These global resources will be one way to gauge a player’s position within the galaxy, with more being better and faster production of each being superior. It might be easier to parse as M/B T/S, because (M/B) produce on the surface, and T/S produce in space.
Fleets, which are organised groups of fighters and infantry that can be sent off through hyperspace to conquer an enemy system. 
Combat and Control
It is the player’s goal to control as many star systems as possible, but control of a star system is determined by control of two entirely orthogonal levels: control of the space surrounding the planets, and control of the ground surface of the planets.
Controlling space enables harvesting all the research results of satellites that produce science, while also containing all production of galactic credits and isolating them to the system in question. Once ground control and space control are established in the hands of a single faction, any accumulated credits will be granted to the victor; but while a star system is contested in terms of space versus ground control, accumulated credits are sequestered and increase the value of the eventual conquest.
Fighter pilots, similar to science, are produced in space and go to the faction that controls space around a system, while infantry are produced on the ground and credited to the faction that controls the surface of the system.
Lanchester’s laws provide a way of modelling these two types of fights, where we assume that taking a planet consists of infantry fighting in narrow corridors to control space elevators or other constrained access points and therefore should be modelled with Lanchester’s linear laws, while we assume that fighter pilots engage in ranged combat and should follow Lanchester’s square law. Here is a nice youtube ,overview of these combat types.
Markets 
Markets are developments which enable the transfer of goods and services required to build all developments including markets themselves. As part of “market making” the markets you own naturally collect a percentage of the value of all those transactions, enabling your empire to invest in further developments.
For each market you build, it will produce one galactic credit per tick on its own. In addition, in your market focus screen you can configure the percentage of focus your markets have on each of the development types, M/T/B/S, and each time one of those developments is built by any other player, your market produces 1 credit per focus point. If you are sufficiently prescient to guess where other players will put most of their investment, your markets will extract correspondingly more value from the underlying transactions.
If you research investing, the total credits produced by your markets is taken to the power 1.XX where XX is your investing research level. So if you were producing 1,000 credits but had researched investing 5, your empire would collect 1412.53 credits.
Training Camps
Your space bound explorations require satellite training camps to entice bright young minds to learn how to pilot your fighter ships to effectively dominate space. In space, there are so many dimensions for combat, and the range of the lasers is vast, that all units can attack all other units in a star system at any given time, lending much weight to the tactics and formations that can be learned in training camps.
Each training camp produces one fighter per tick. When combat between fighter groups A and B happens, the number of survivors is sqrt(αA2 - βB2), and the order of the subtraction determines who wins (that is, if αΑ2 - βB2 < 0, A loses; reverse the equation). Here is a sample table of outcomes to give a sense of this with both players at tactics 1:
A
B
A Wins
B Wins
1000
250
968

1500

1750


1436


As can be seen in the above table, small edges in fighter ships lead to decisive victories in space. If you research formations, each research level increments your coefficient β by one.
Bases
Training camps are developments which produce infantry units suitable for defending your systems planetary resources or being transported in fleets to conquer other systems. Each training camp produces one infantry per tick on the system where the training camp was built. In combat, each infantry unit does 1 damage to the other party per round.
If you research recruiting, your produced infantry are taken to the power 1.XX where XX is your recruiting level. If you research melee fighting, the damage of an infantry unit is XX where XX is your melee level. Melee fighting is done in rounds, with the defenders doing first damage, until one side is reduced to nothing. Similar to the space case, this can be summarised as the remaining troops are αA - βB for initial sizes A, B and the positive orientation of this formula tells you who would win. For two armies with melee 1, here is an example set of outcomes:

A
B
A Wins
B Wins

Here we see that victory is directly proportional to the size of the invading army and casualties are directly proportional to the size of the defending army.
Space Stations
Each space station you build produces 1 research point per tick towards your chosen area of research. The possible research areas are:
Scanning
Navigation
Terraforming
Investing
Formations
Melee
Recruiting
Innovation
Scanning gives you a probability of sensing data about star systems and fleets X light years away from you at (level2 * 10) / X, so at level 1 scanning you can sense information within 10 light years accurately every tick, while at a distance of 100 light years your chances are only 1/10 of acquiring any sensor data.
Navigation enables your fleets to travel to far away systems. Each level of navigation enables your captains to successfully reach systems that are level * 10 light years away.
Terraforming enables you to build developments on planets. Each level of terraforming  takes your resource extraction for the system to the power 1.XX where XX is your terraforming level.
Investing, formations, melee and recruiting are technologies that affect markets, training camps, and bases respectively as already described.
Finally, Innovation takes the total science produced by your empire to the power 1.XX where XX is your innovation level.

## Prompt 2: Assertive Design

remove verbiage like "initial" "tentative" "provisional" etc from these documents. Write as though the end state is determined. It isn't "Affinities should create complementary strengths..." it's "Affinities create complementary strengths". Be brief and assertive.

## Prompt 3: Adopt Prompt Hygiene

let's adopt the prompt hygeine of ../beyond for this project. Review that, create PROMPTS.md and put up PR#1 for this project, which also needs a new GPLv3 public github repo created by gh
